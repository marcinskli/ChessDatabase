## Aim of the project
It's hard to get a good chess base these days. First of all not all of them are for free.

The best free for personal use only source of games for chess database that I found is published weekly by 
[TWIC - The Week In Chess Magazine](https://theweekinchess.com/twic). The author cover games from international 
tournaments and publish them as the PGN file every week since 2012. All of them combined weight more than 1GB
and contain about <b>1,5 million games</b>.

Well, that's a lot. Not all of them are useful though. What do I mean by that?
In chess database we can find:
* games played by lower rated players:
 * they aren't useful for learning openings,
 * they aren't useful for learning plans for middlegame,
 * they aren't useful for endgames either,
* games that have low number of moves:
 * a lot of games end after few moves after a predetermined draw,
 * even more games doesn't even have any moves,
* games from different game modes (mostly chess960):
 * they mess up statistics, create problems for chess base reader programs and <i>(most importantly)</i> 
   they are not chess games!
* games without the result:
 * for unknown reason, sometimes someone doesn't put result, and that is bad for statistics too.

The purpose of the project is to get clean, useful chess database from which you can work on chess.
Program allows you to filter games to get only ones that can be useful for studying.
